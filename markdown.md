## Markdown 101
Markdown is one of the easiest ways to *stylize* your web page and **text** since you edit stuff without full knowladge of HTML and other coding languages.
# Some of the things you can do:
1. writing text in diffrent styles like *Italic* **bold** or ~~strike through~~ .
2. make lists and tables.
3. add images, links And profile mentions.
It also helps you to publish your work easily.

**some examples on syntax features as questions**
1. what syntax do you have to use to make this word (ABC) Italic?
- [ ] "_ABC _"
- [ ] "** ABC **"
2. what syntax do you have to use to make this word (ABC) Strikthrough?
- [ ] "~~ ABC ~~"
- [ ] "* ABC *"
