### Growth mindset

Growth mindset is one of the best mind sets to utilize every bit of creativity and talent you have, and also a reminder that everyone started from some place at the begining.
A reminder that talent alone isn't good enough wihout hard work and passion towards the thing you're trying to master or achieve. 


## 3 Main Keys to mind growth:
# A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
# Roll with the punches.
# keep your head up and look for the next goal.
